            Do you think your local butcher will
            reduce the amount of meat she orders from the slaughterhouse if you
            become a vegetarian? Of course not! 
            <span class="assertion" draggable=true ondragstart="dragstart_handler(event,

                quantities that a single person consumes.</span> 
            <span class="assertion" draggable=true ondragstart="dragstart_handler(event,

                )">So by becoming a vegetarian, you'll never save a single animal’s life!</span> 
            But 
            <span class="assertion" draggable=true ondragstart="dragstart_handler(event,
                'by becoming a vegetarian you will deprive yourself of the pleasure of eating meat'
