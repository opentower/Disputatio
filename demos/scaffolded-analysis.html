                    As I write this, in November 1971, people are dying in East
                    Bengal from lack of food, shelter, and medical care. The
                    suffering and death that are occurring there now are not
                    inevitable, not unavoidable in any fatalistic sense of the
                    term. Constant poverty, a cyclone, and a civil war have
                    turned at least nine million people into destitute
                    refugees; nevertheless, {it is not beyond the capacity of
                    the richer nations to give enough assistance to reduce any
                    further suffering to very small proportions|Members of
                    affluent nations can reduce the suffering in Bengal}. The
                    decisions and actions of human beings can prevent this kind
                    of suffering.  Unfortunately, human beings have not made
                    the necessary decisions. At the individual level, people
                    have, with very few exceptions, not responded to the
                    situation in any significant way.
                </p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>
                    What are the moral implications of a situation like this?
                    In what follows, {I shall argue that the way people in
                    relatively affluent countries react to a situation like
                    that in Bengal cannot be justified|The failure of citizens
                    of richer nations to assist Bengal is unjustifiable };
                    indeed, the whole way we look at moral issues-our moral
                    conceptual scheme needs to be altered, and with it, the way
                    of life that has come to be taken for granted in our
                    society.
                </p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>
                    I begin with the assumption that {suffering and death from
                    lack of food, shelter, and medical care are bad|suffering
                    caused by lack of food, shelter and care is bad.}. {I
                    think most people will agree about this|This is obvious.},
                    although one may reach the same view by different routes.
                    I shall not argue for this view. People can hold all sorts
                    of eccentric positions, and perhaps from some of them it
                    would not follow that death by starvation is in itself bad.
                    It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to refute such
                    positions, and so for brevity I will henceforth take this
                    assumption as accepted. Those who disagree need read no
                    further. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My next point is this: {if it is in our power to prevent
                    something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing
                    anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally,
                    to do it |To fail to prevent bad things when you can do so
                    without moral compromise, is wrong} . By "without
                    sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance" I mean
                    without causing anything else comparably bad to happen, or
                    doing something that is wrong in itself, or failing to
                    promote some moral good, comparable in significance to the
                    bad thing that we can prevent. {This principle seems almost
                    as uncontroversial as the last one|This is obvious.}. It
                    requires us only to prevent what is bad, and not to promote
                    what is good, and it requires this of us only when we can
                    do it without sacrificing anything that is, from the moral
                    point of view, comparably important. I could even, as far
                    as the application of my argument to the Bengal emergency
                    is concerned, qualify the point so as to make it: if it is
                    in our power to prevent something very bad from happening,
                    without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant,
                    we ought, morally, to do it. An application of this
                    principle would be as follows: if I am walking past
                    a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to
                    wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my
                    clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death
                    of the child would presumably be a very bad thing. 
                </p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>
                    I do not think I need to say much in defense of the refusal
                    to take proximity and distance into account. The fact that
                    a person is physically near to us, so that we have personal
                    contact with him, may make it more likely that we shall
                    assist him, but this does not show that we ought to help
                    him rather than another who happens to be further away. If
                    we accept any principle of impartiality,
                    universalizability, equality, or whatever, we cannot
                    discriminate against someone merely because he is far away
                    from us (or we are far away from him).  Admittedly, it is
                    possible that we are in a better position to judge what
                    needs to be done to help a person near to us than one far
                    away, and perhaps also to provide the assistance we judge
                    to be necessary. If this were the case, it would be
                    a reason for helping those near to us first. This may once
                    have been a justification for being more concerned with the
                    poor in one's own town than with famine victims in India.
                    Unfortunately for those who- like to keep their moral
                    responsibilities limited, instant communication and swift
                    transportation have changed the situation. From the moral
                    point of view, the development of the world into a "global
                    village" has made an important, though still unrecognized,
                    difference to our moral situation. Expert observers and
                    supervisors, sent out by famine relief organizations or
                    permanently stationed in famine-prone areas, can direct our
                    aid to a refugee in Bengal almost as effectively as we
                    could get it to someone in our own block.  There would
                    seem, therefore, to be no possible justification for
                    discriminating on geographical grounds. 
                </p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>
                    The view that numbers do make a difference can be made plausible if stated in
                    this way: if everyone in circumstances like mine gave ?5 to the Bengal Relief
                    Fund, there would be enough to provide food, shelter, and medical care for the
                    refugees; there is no reason why I should give more than anyone else in the
                    same circumstances as I am; therefore I have no obligation to give more than
                    ?5. Each premise in this argument is true, and the argument looks sound. It may
                    con- vince us, unless we notice that it is based on a hypothetical premise,
                    although the conclusion is not stated hypothetically. The argument would be
                    sound if the conclusion were: if everyone in circumstances like mine were to
                    give $5, I would have no obligation to give more than $5. If the conclusion
                    were so stated, however, it would be obvious that the argument has no bearing
                    on a situation in which it is not the case that everyone else gives $5. This,
                    of course, is the actual situation. It is more or less certain that not
                    everyone in circumstances like mine will give $5. So there will not be enough
                    to provide the needed food, shelter, and medical care. Therefore by giving more
                    than $5 I will prevent more suffering than I would if I gave just $5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It might be thought that this argument has an absurd consequence.  Since the
                    situation appears to be that very few people are likely to give substantial
                    amounts, it follows that I and everyone else in similar circumstances ought to
                    give as much as possible, that is, at least up to the point at which by giving
                    more one would begin to cause serious suffering for oneself and one's
                    dependents-perhaps even beyond this point to the point of marginal utility, at
                    which by giving more one would cause oneself and one's dependents as much
                    suffering as one would prevent in Bengal. If everyone does this, however, there
                    will be more than can be used for the benefit of the refugees, and some of the
                    sacrifice will have been unnecessary. Thus, if everyone does what he ought to
                    do, the result will not be as good as it would be if everyone did a little less
                    than he ought to do, or if only some do all that they ought to do. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The paradox here arises only if we assume that the actions in question-sending
                    money to the relief funds-are performed more or less simultaneously, and are
                    also unexpected. For if it is to be expected that everyone is going to
                    contribute something, then clearly each is not obliged to give as much as he
                    would have been obliged to had others not been giving too.  And if everyone is
                    not acting more or less simultaneously, then those giving later will know how
                    much more is needed, and will have no obligation to give more than is necessary
                    to reach this amount. To say this is not to deny the principle that people in
                    the same circumstances have the same obligations, but to point out that the
                    fact that others have given, or may be expected to give, is a relevant
                    circumstance: those giving after it has become known that many others are
                    giving and those giving before are not in the same circumstances. So the
                    seemingly absurd consequence of the principle I have put forward can occur only
                    if people are in error about the actual circumstances-that is, if they think
                    they are giving when others are not, but in fact they are giving when others
                    are. The result of everyone doing what he really ought to do cannot be worse
                    than the result of everyone doing less than he ought to do, although the result
                    of everyone doing what he reasonably believes he ought to do could be.
