                        As I write this, in November 1971, people are dying in East
                        Bengal from lack of food, shelter, and medical care. The
                        suffering and death that are occurring there now are not
                        inevitable, not unavoidable in any fatalistic sense of the
                        term. Constant poverty, a cyclone, and a civil war have
                        turned at least nine million people into destitute
                        refugees; nevertheless, {it is not beyond the capacity of
                        the richer nations to give enough assistance to reduce any
                        further suffering to very small proportions|Members of
                        affluent nations can reduce the suffering in Bengal}. The
                        decisions and actions of human beings can prevent this kind
                        of suffering.  Unfortunately, human beings have not made
                        the necessary decisions. At the individual level, people
                        have, with very few exceptions, not responded to the
                        situation in any significant way.

                    <p >…</p>
                    <p>
                        What are the moral implications of a situation like this?
                        In what follows, {I shall argue that the way people in
                        relatively affluent countries react to a situation like
                        that in Bengal cannot be justified|The failure of citizens
                        of richer nations to assist Bengal is unjustifiable };
                        indeed, the whole way we look at moral issues-our moral
                        conceptual scheme needs to be altered, and with it, the way
                        of life that has come to be taken for granted in our
                        society.
                    </p>
                    <p>…</p>
                </div>
                <div id="p3">
                    <p>
                        I begin with the assumption that {suffering and death from
                        lack of food, shelter, and medical care are bad|suffering
                        caused by lack of food, shelter and care is bad.}. {I
                        think most people will agree about this|This is obvious.},
                        although one may reach the same view by different routes.
                        I shall not argue for this view. People can hold all sorts
                        of eccentric positions, and perhaps from some of them it
                        would not follow that death by starvation is in itself bad.
                        It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to refute such
                        positions, and so for brevity I will henceforth take this
                        assumption as accepted. Those who disagree need read no
                        further.

                    <p>
                        My next point is this: {if it is in our power to prevent
                        something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing
                        anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally,
                        to do it |To fail to prevent bad things when you can do so
                        without moral compromise, is wrong} . By "without
                        sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance" I mean
                        without causing anything else comparably bad to happen, or
                        doing something that is wrong in itself, or failing to
                        promote some moral good, comparable in significance to the
                        bad thing that we can prevent. {This principle seems almost
                        as uncontroversial as the last one|This is obvious.}. It
                        requires us only to prevent what is bad, and not to promote
                        what is good, and it requires this of us only when we can
                        do it without sacrificing anything that is, from the moral
                        point of view, comparably important. I could even, as far
                        as the application of my argument to the Bengal emergency
                        is concerned, qualify the point so as to make it: if it is
                        in our power to prevent something very bad from happening,
                        without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant,
                        we ought, morally, to do it. An application of this
                        principle would be as follows: if I am walking past
                        a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to
                        wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my
                        clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death
                        of the child would presumably be a very bad thing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>…</p>
                </div>
                <div id="p5">
                    <p>
                        I do not think I need to say much in defense of the refusal
                        to take proximity and distance into account. The fact that
                        a person is physically near to us, so that we have personal
                        contact with him, may make it more likely that we shall
                        assist him, but this does not show that we ought to help
                        him rather than another who happens to be further away. If
                        we accept any principle of impartiality,
                        universalizability, equality, or whatever, we cannot
                        discriminate against someone merely because he is far away
                        from us (or we are far away from him).  Admittedly, {it is
                        possible that we are in a better position to judge what
                        needs to be done to help a person near to us than one far
                        away, and perhaps also to provide the assistance we judge
                        to be necessary|It is easier to help those nearby.}. If
                        this were the case, it would be a reason for {helping those
                        near to us first|we should always help those near to us
                        first}. This may once have been a justification for being
                        more concerned with the poor in one's own town than with
                        famine victims in India.  Unfortunately for those who like
                        to keep their moral responsibilities limited, instant
                        communication and swift transportation have changed the
                        situation. From the moral point of view, the development of
                        the world into a "global village" has made an important,
                        though still unrecognized, difference to our moral
                        situation. {Expert observers and supervisors, sent out by
                        famine relief organizations or permanently stationed in
                        famine-prone areas, can direct our aid to a refugee in
                        Bengal almost as effectively as we could get it to someone
                        in our own block|Modern infrastructure makes it at least as
                        easy to help people far away as those nearby.}. There would
                        seem, therefore, to be no possible justification for
                        discriminating on geographical grounds.

                    <p>
                        The view that {numbers do make a difference|it is permissible
                        to only do a little when you are not the only one who can
                        help} can be made plausible if stated in this way: if
                        {everyone in circumstances like mine gave $5 to the Bengal
                        Relief Fund, there would be enough to provide food,
                        shelter, and medical care for the refugees|If everyone did
                        their part, everyone would only need to do a little};
                        {there is no reason why I should give more than anyone else
                        in the same circumstances as I am|What I need to do is the
                        same as what everyone else needs to do}; therefore I have
                        no obligation to give more than $5. Each premise in this
                        argument is true, and the argument looks sound.  It may
                        convince us, unless we notice that {it is based on
                        a hypothetical premise, although the conclusion is not
                        stated hypothetically|The conclusion only follow *if*
                        everyone does their part}. The argument would be sound if
                        the conclusion were: if everyone in circumstances like mine
                        were to give $5, I would have no obligation to give more
                        than $5. If the conclusion were so stated, however, it
                        would be obvious that the argument has no bearing on
                        a situation in which it is not the case that everyone else
                        gives $5. This, of course, is the actual situation. It is
                        more or less certain that not everyone in circumstances
                        like mine will give $5. So there will not be enough to
                        provide the needed food, shelter, and medical care.
                        Therefore by giving more than $5 I will prevent more
                        suffering than I would if I gave just $5.
